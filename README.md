# Language Learning Tetris

A version of the classic game for learning phrases in a new language.  Each block has a word, and vertically adjacent blocks that form phrases in the correct order disappear.

The game uses the pygame library for the interface, and uses [a graph to store data](https://github.com/Nasreen123/language_tetris/blob/master/Exploring%20graph%20algorithms%20for%20storing%20game%20data.ipynb).
 
Run language\_tetris.py to play (type ```python language_tetris.py``` into your terminal)
